# Daijishō

Daijishō is a retro launcher that lets you manage your retro games libraries. Daijishō cares about integrated experience, expansibility, aesthetic, and pragmatic usabilities, which let you focus on the games themselves. It will be updated continuously in the future based on user feedback and my own retro gaming experience during my free time. Beware, it does not come with emulators.

"Wat? What does 'Daijishō' even mean?", you ask? "Daijishō" (aka "だいじしょう") actually stands for ["台字章"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E7%B8%BD%E7%9D%A3%E5%BA%9C%E6%96%87%E5%AE%98%E6%9C%8D%E8%A3%9D) in kanji, which was a pattern widely used in Taiwan during the Japanese period. Anyway, happy gaming.

> Here is my widgets setup :3
### How Much Effort does the Author put into this Project?
This is a side project. The project is solely developed on my Retroid Pocket 2+ and Android emulators. I will continue work on it whenever I feel motivated to (in my free time; usually on the weekend).

### What can you do to Support?
You can star this GitHub page, donate, promote Daijishō in the communities or update the platform list in this GitHub page.

### Taking a Break from the Project
Daijishō evolved a lot in 2022. Including UI improvements, retro achievements, wallpaper packs, the new widgets page, genres, backup, merge items and various other small details. I know that there is still room for Daijishō to grow and things to be improved. And I am thankfully aware of people's ideas and suggestions. However, In the meantime, I also have important things to be done awaiting me. And it's time for me to leave for a while from this repetitive routine for 12 continuous months. Thus, I decided to take a break from the Daijishō project, probably for quarters. With the relatively low attention and activities focusing on Daijishō. Nevertheless, if you are familiar with Android Kotlin development and you wish to contribute or intergrate features for Daijishō, you can still DM me for the possibilities.
